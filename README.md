# node-storefront

node-storefront is a node.js CLI application linked to a mySQL database.  The application keeps an inventory of various items and departments. The application includes three user interfaces that each contain seperate commands:

* storefrontCustomer
* storefrontManager
* storefrontSupervisor

### storefrontCustomer

![customer image](images/customer.png)

This interface displays a table that displays the inventory information from the sql database file.  It displays the item's ID, Name, Department, Price, and Stock.  The user is prompted to input an ID number for the item they would like to purchase and the amount of stock they would like to purchase.  The database stock is updated and the purchase cost is returned to the user. 

### storefrontManager

This interface gives the user four options:

* View Products for Sale

This shows the user the same table that the customer can access.

![manager view products](images/manager-viewproducts.png)

* View Low Inventory

This creates and displays a table that shows all inventory that has less than 5 stock.

* Add New Product

Prompts the user for information to create a new item and push it to the database.
